Here’s a refined version of that sentence — polished for professional tone and clarity, suitable for a **self-evaluation comment** or **performance review**:

---

> I **led the team in Q2** through a **very critical, time-sensitive, and high-pressure phase** to successfully deliver the **Topaz Global Order Manager for the Taiwan location**. Despite the challenges, I maintained team focus, ensured clear communication, and effectively managed priorities to achieve on-time delivery and meet business expectations.

If you’d like it integrated into your full **contribution comment** alongside the other project achievements, here’s how it would flow naturally:

---

### **Contribution Comment (Revised)**

> During this review period, I successfully **led multiple APAC SCC initiatives**, including the **Taiwan Order Manager**, **Digital Banking Phone Banking Authenticator**, and the **Topaz Global Order Manager for Taiwan** projects.
>
> In **Q2**, I **led the team through a very critical, time-sensitive, and high-pressure delivery period** for the **Topaz Global Order Manager for Taiwan**. Through strong coordination, prioritization, and stakeholder management, we achieved successful delivery on schedule, paving the way for the **decommissioning of the legacy COPS Order Manager platform**, resulting in **vendor cost savings** and **reduced operational risk**.
>
> Additionally, the **Phone Banking Authenticator** project enabled **Client Advisors to digitally authenticate clients**, ensuring **regulatory compliance** and providing a **digital audit trail** for order-taking processes.
>

Would you like me to make this version concise enough for direct entry into a self-evaluation form (around 150–200 words)?
