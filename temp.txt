Successfully set up a new team and OME pod in India, tackling the challenge of building a new team and ensuring the OME pod's operational setup, laying the foundation for future growth and innovation.

Led key initiatives for Taiwan’s Order Manager (OM) journey, driving critical projects such as the Core Banking Adapter, Contact Management, Approval Workflow Interface, and Client Instructions, aligning them with regional needs and business objectives.

Collaborated with security, technical, and domain architects to design and implement a Client Authentication solution to ensure full compliance with regulatory requirements.

Delivered the Core Banking Adapter solution in production, facilitating order bookings in Midas and cash balance checks in Topaz, enhancing transaction accuracy and operational efficiency.

Successfully implemented the Approval Workflow Interface solution up to TE2, streamlining the approval process and improving workflow efficiency.

Aligned Contact Management solution with the Global BAC stream for Taiwan, ensuring seamless integration with global systems while meeting local requirements.

Enhanced the impact of the OME application by adopting a multi-entity, multi-location design, leading to significant cost reductions and operational efficiencies.

Focused on best practices in software design and clean coding, ensuring robust MERs, adherence to regulatory compliance, and effective Azure cost monitoring to optimize system performance and expenses.

Engaged stakeholders at every stage of product delivery, ensuring clear communication, alignment, and satisfaction throughout the project lifecycle.

Took on the challenge of setting up a new team and successfully delivered projects in line with WMPC tech guidelines, demonstrating strong leadership and project management skills.

Achieved Gold Certified Engineer status as part of my continuous professional development and commitment to upskilling, strengthening my technical expertise.

Looking ahead to 2025, I aim to leverage the institutional knowledge and experience gained this year to drive even greater impact and further improve delivery outcomes for future projects.

Accountability with Integrity: "I have taken ownership of SCC components, including the core banking adapter, contact management, approval workflow interface, and client instructions, leading end-to-end delivery for these initiatives. I have organized and trained my team to ensure effective delivery, fostering a collaborative approach to achieve our goals. I’ve proposed solutions to address business challenges and lead from the front on technical decisions, driving continuous improvement in our processes."

Collaboration: "I engage stakeholders regularly for feedback, as demonstrated with the contact management project, where I presented prototypes and integrated user feedback to refine the product. I collaborate with various IT and business teams to ensure smooth delivery, such as working with the Taiwan Crew for regional integrations, Topaz and PCM digital teams for system integration, and Tech Services for authentication solutions. By fostering these cross-functional partnerships, I help deliver solutions that align with strategic business requirements and improve overall project success."

Innovation: "To improve project quality and efficiency, I actively seek opportunities to enhance code quality, implement clean coding practices, optimize cloud usage, and reduce costs. By continuously looking for ways to improve our processes and designs, I contribute to the long-term success of the projects and ensure we deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions."

Effective Delegation: I see an opportunity to improve my delegation skills, ensuring tasks are distributed more efficiently among team members. This would allow me to focus on higher-level strategic decisions while empowering my team to take ownership of key areas, improving overall team productivity.

Impact on Technical Architectural Decisions: I aim to be more impactful in shaping technical architecture decisions by gaining a deeper understanding of design principles and contributing more to high-level architectural discussions. This will allow me to influence the direction of solutions more effectively and ensure better alignment with long-term objectives.

Understanding Product Management: Gaining a deeper understanding of product management practices will help me better align technical decisions with product goals.

Product Branding and Multi-Location/Use Case Focus: I aim to improve in branding and socializing product builds for multi-location and multi-use case scenarios

Further Drill Down on Azure Cloud Usage and Costs: I see an opportunity to further explore and optimize our Azure cloud usage, specifically focusing on cost management. 

Eager to growing institutional and technical knowledge to further increase impact and drive high-quality delivery for our projects.
